# COMP-562-Final-Project

This is a group research project for COMP 562: Intro to Machine Learning.

Members: @Yixuan Cheng, @Jiamy Ding, @Qian Yu

Topic: Heart Disease Diagnosis with machine Learning

Dataset: Heart Failure Prediction Dataset (from Kaggle)

Description: We built a binary classification model that can be useful in predicting the presence of heart disease based on the input parameters. 
Possible use cases is to facilitate heart disease diagnoise for medical institution.

Methods used:
1.	Preprocess data and visualization (Matplotlib, seaborn, plotly)
2.	KNN, Decision Treee, Ramdom Forest Model a) Evaluate precision, recall, accuracy, F1 score, confusion matrix, ROC curve, AUC score
